1. INTRODUCTION

JavaScript makes pages more reactive

It can run in any device that has a JS engine (like V8 in Chrome and SpiderMonkey in Firefox).
The engine 'reads' the script and then 'compiles' it as it runs. It watches the code, as it runs, analyzing data and possible optimizations.
* Google's V8 was extracted to run JS outside the browser (server-side JS): Node.js!

In-browser (client-side) JS can manipulate HTML objects, react to user actions, send request to servers, get and set cookies,
remember data on client-side (local storage).

JS unique characteristics: integration with HTML/CSS, simplicity, supported by almost every browser

Languages created over JS:
- TypeScript <3 developed by Microsoft, includes data typing (JS is weakly typed)
- Dart: developed by Google. Has its own engine for mobile apps
- Kotlin: browser or Node friendly.
and so on...
These languages are converted (transpiled) to JS before they run in browser.

Data types in JS are dinamically assumed and can change through code.
