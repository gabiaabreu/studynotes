/*

    * VARIABLES
Variable naming: use camelCase in most cases
human-readable and meaningful names
keep it clean without special characters (excluding $ and _, which can be used)
when naming hard-coded values, you could also go for something like: 
*/

const COLOR_RED: string = "#ff0000";

/*

OBS: don't name consts like that when their value is unknown at first.

'var' isn't used anymore. Always go for 'let' or 'const'.

a 'shadowed variable' is a local variable which also exists as a global one
