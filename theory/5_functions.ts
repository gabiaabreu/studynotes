/*

        * FUNCTIONS

function name(param: ParamType) {}

fun fact: JS will read your file before executing it, take all functions and
put them first, so there's no difference in where you put them in the code.
you can call a function first and later define it.

return stops a function, anything after it won't be read

const button = document.getElementById("click-me-btn");
button.addEventListener('click', addNumbers(1, 2));
