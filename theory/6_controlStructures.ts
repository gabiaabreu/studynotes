/* 

        CONTROL STRUCTURES 

    LOOPS: While and for

fun fact: any part of 'for' can be skipped, see below
    for(; i < 5 ;) 
that is possible and acts just like 
    while(i < 5)

breaking loops: use break!
    if(value === 5) break;

you could also use continue, to force the loop to stop there and to start a new iteration
    if(value === 5) continue;
s
